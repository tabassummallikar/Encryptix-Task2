**Overview of the Project**

**Project: To-Do List Application**

**Objective**

The objective of this program is to create a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to select an operation and input two numbers, then displays the result based on the chosen operation.

**Key Activities**

Operation Selection: User chooses between addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Input Validation: Ensures valid operation choice and numeric inputs.

Perform Operation: Executes the corresponding mathematical operation.

Division Check: Handles division by zero error.

Display Result: Outputs the result of the chosen operation.

**Technologies Used**

Python: The entire calculator is implemented in Python, utilizing its syntax and built-in functionalities.

Functions: Custom functions are created for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to promote code reuse and modularity.

Input Handling: The application uses standard input functions (input()) to capture user choices and numbers.

Error Handling: The try-except block is employed to manage exceptions, ensuring the program can handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values and division by zero).

Control Flow: Conditional statements (if, elif, and else) are used to determine which mathematical operation to perform based on user input.

**Key Insights**

Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

User Interaction: Provides a menu for operation selection and prompts for number inputs.

Input Validation: Checks for valid operation and number inputs to prevent errors.

Division Handling: Includes error handling for division by zero.
